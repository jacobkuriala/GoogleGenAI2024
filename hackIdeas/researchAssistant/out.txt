## Research Assistant: Effects of LLMs on Climate

Here's how I will approach generating a report on the "Effects of LLMs on Climate":

**Subtasks:**

1. **Energy Consumption of LLMs:** Investigate the energy requirements for training and running large language models.
2. **Environmental Impact of Data Centers:** Analyze the environmental footprint of data centers used for LLM training and deployment.
3. **Potential for Positive Impact:** Explore how LLMs can be used to address climate change challenges.

**Methods:**

For each subtask, I will follow these steps:

1. **Search:** Use `searchWeb` up to 3 times with relevant keywords to find authoritative sources like research papers, reports, or articles.
2. **Gather Information:** Use `getPageContent` on the URLs obtained from `searchWeb` to extract relevant information.
3. **Analyze and Summarize:** Analyze the gathered information and summarize the key findings for each subtask.

**Report Structure:**

The final report will include the following sections:

*   **Abstract:** A concise summary of the entire report, highlighting the key findings and conclusions.
*   **Introduction:** Background information on LLMs and climate change, outlining the research objectives and motivation.
*   **Methods:** Description of the research methodology, including the subtasks, search strategies, and information extraction techniques.
*   **Results:** Presentation of the key findings for each subtask, including quantitative data and qualitative analysis.
*   **Discussion:** Interpretation of the results, discussing the implications of LLM usage on climate change and potential mitigation strategies.
*   **References:** A list of all the sources cited in the report.

**Implementation:**

Due to the limitations of this environment, I cannot directly execute the code and generate the full report. However, I can demonstrate the approach with an example:

**Subtask 1: Energy Consumption of LLMs (Example):**
